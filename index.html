        Simple, popular joint dishing out idli, vada & other breakfast bites, along with coffee. The food is amazing, although the menu is very simple. They do not have much food, and there are no chairs. You stand, eat your food and leave. Although it is not a very elegent place to eat, the place is always packed.</p>

        Ancient world wonder that winds for more than 5,500 miles across China, with towers & walkways, the Great Wall of China is a fun place to visit. It is a big challenge to walk the whole thing, which runs for more than 5,500 miles. The whole wall was stuck together with sticky rice. The Great Wall of China is a fun place to visit and is very historic.</p>

        <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head disemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

         <p>Five out of Five.
           "The Lion King" has been one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself consistently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's astounding, dazzling visuals, and this is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. Jon Favreau and his crew pulled it off so well, and how on earth did they do it? Let me explain: When it comes to the craftsmanship, it is an incredible technical achievement; in beats, we all knew it has the same story, but as you are watching it, you are wondering how the filmmaking techniques will execute the same story differently, and I did not expect much at all. Jon Favreau displays his best direction here due to his effective and persistent timing and cadence. Not to mention that he has showcased the movie's heart that is in the perfect place, because of how well he handles the tone.</p>
